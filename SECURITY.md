# Security Policy

Reported vulnerabilities can be found on [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=go).

## Supported Versions

Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out).

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.

If you've discovered a security vulnerability in the tool, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner, using [this form](https://forms.gle/b5dqvbwgd71ShgEMA) or if you prefer to avoid GForms and use the [VulnDB of Go](https://github.com/golang/vulndb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Needs+Triage%2CDirect+External+Report&template=new_third_party_vuln.yml&title=x%2Fvulndb%3A+potential+Go+vuln+in+github.com%2fdavidaparicio%2fnamecheck).

At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
